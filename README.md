# Faster-Field-Calculations-for-ArcGIS-Desktop
Field calculations in ArcGIS Desktop can be painfully slow when there are many records (e.g.,>30,000) especially when the calculation is occurring with a joined table.

Faster calculations can be achieved using Python Libraries to store values and Arcpy Search Cursors update values.

The Python Toolbox supplied here has a tool for field calculations within an existing table and second tool for field calculation that would be performed between two tables.
